# Portfolio-Website

## Welcome to my Business Page!

### My project was made with the following technologies:

#### Front-End
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- BootStrap

#### Back-End
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Axios
- Zoho 3rd Party API

This website highlights some of the best work I’ve done so far — while being a platform to receive real time communication. Most of what you see here was hardcoded by me from the ground up.

A couple features I’m especially proud of are the mobile hamburger menu and the contact form.

The contact form was built and styled using standard HTML and CSS. I set up an Express Application that's connected directly to my Zoho account, so I can receive a notification whenver someone sends a message using my contact form.

I chose these technologies to challenge myself and stay grounded in the fundamentals. With AI becoming more common, it’s easy to rely it — but I believe that true growth comes from challenging your skill level through continuous practice. Without that foundation, you won't be able to keep up with changing times. That’s what this site represents for me: improving with intention to keep up with the times.
