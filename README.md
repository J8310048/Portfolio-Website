# Portfolio-Website

## Welcome to my Portfolio Page!

### My project was made with the following technologies:

#### Front-End
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- BootStrap
- Materialize
- Animate.css

#### Back-End
- Node.js
- Express.js
- nodemailer

This portfolio website highlights some of the best work I’ve done so far — while staying open to growth and future improvements. Most of what you see here was hardcoded by me from the ground up.

A couple features I’m especially proud of are the mobile hamburger menu and the contact form.

The contact form was built and styled using standard HTML and CSS. I set up an API that connects it directly to my email, so when someone wants to reach out, it’s just a click away. On the backend, I used Node.js to build an Express app that handles POST requests and sends emails using Nodemailer — a tool that lets you send messages through your own email account.

I chose these technologies (especially on the front end) to challenge myself and stay grounded in the fundamentals. With AI solutions becoming more common, it’s easy to rely on them — but I believe that true growth comes from doing the hard work yourself. Without that foundation, there’s not much to build on. That’s what this site is all about for me: improving with intention and putting in the reps.
